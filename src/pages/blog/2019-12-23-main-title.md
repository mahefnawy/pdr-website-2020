  We’re proud to announce that we’ll be offering a small batch of Jamaica Blue
  Mountain coffee beans in our store next week.




  We expect the shipment of a limited quantity of green beans next Monday. We’ll
  be offering the roasted beans from Tuesday, but quantities are limited, so be
  quick.




  Blue Mountain Peak is the highest mountain in Jamaica and one of the highest
  peaks in the Caribbean at 7,402 ft. It is the home of Blue Mountain coffee and
  their famous tours. It is located on the border of the Portland and Saint
  Thomas parishes of Jamaica.




  # A little history




  The Blue Mountains are considered by many to be a hiker's and camper's
  paradise. The traditional Blue Mountain trek is a 7-mile hike to the peak and
  consists of a 3,000-foot increase in elevation. Jamaicans prefer to reach the
  peak at sunrise, thus the 3–4 hour hike is usually undertaken in darkness.
  Since the sky is usually very clear in the mornings, Cuba can be seen in the
  distance.




  Some of the plants found on the Blue Mountain cannot be found anywhere else in
  the world and they are often of a dwarfed sort.




  This is mainly due to the cold climate which inhibits growth. The small coffee
  farming communities of Claverty Cottage and Hagley Gap are located near the
  peak.
